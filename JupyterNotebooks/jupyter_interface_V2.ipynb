    "# RT2 Assignment 2 -- Jupyter GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a minimal graphic interface which enables the user to\n",
    "\n",
    "- check the working status of the robot\n",
    "- drive te robot manually\n",
    "- switch the random behaviour\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the nodes Jupyter refers to. The structure of the document will be explaied later, as well as its content. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `go_to_point.py` -- motion planning\n",
    "    \n",
    "The node implements a simple motion planning algorithm as a state machine. It is implemented as ROS1 Action Service, so the working cycle is interruptible in any time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The node receives a mission; the action is called `go_to_point`, and receives a goal of type (x, y, theta). The working cycle follows in sequence three steps: head orientation towards the point to reach; try to reach the point along a straight line (the implicit assumption is that *there are no obstacles between the actual position and the one to reach*), and finally align the orientation with the one in the goal. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The node can control the robot using the topics `/cmd_vel` (give a command as Twist to the actuators) and `/odom` (check the current position of the robot). \n",
    "    \n",
    "In order to support Jupyter (see the first graph in section 5), the node also sends the current command in real time through the topic `/current_cmd_vel` reserved for Jupyter. \n",
    "    \n",
    "No other changes have been made on this node compared to [the previous version](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1/blob/action/src/position_service.cpp). \n",
    "\n",
    "### `position_service.cpp` -- random position inside the space\n",
    "\n",
    "This node hasn't been touched compared to [the previous version](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1/blob/action/src/position_service.cpp). \n",
    "\n",
    "It implements a simple service of type `rt2_assignment_2/msg/RandomPosition` and with name `/position_server`: given the bounds wihin to generate the coordinates, a random position + random orientation is generated randomly from the node. Since te first version, the angle has no bounds: it can be generated in the entire turn angle in radiants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `state_machine.cpp` -- implementation of the random behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "The random behaviour is controlled by this node, which is very similar to the one in [the previous version](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1/blob/action/src/state_machine.cpp) but with some important changes, needed to support Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project also contains the new message type `JupyterTargetInfo` with a lot of informations about \n",
    "\n",
    "- if the random behaviour is active or not\n",
    "- how much time the mission is going on\n",
    "- the result of the mission (success, error, out of time, cancelled)\n",
    "- the current goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The node sends this kind o message to Jupyter every time there's something new (so, it's not a regular publisher). See the section **Status of the node StateMachine** for more details about the statistics from this node and how they are represented inside this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `jupyter_user_interface.py` -- jupyter support\n",
    "\n",
    "This node is completely new. Its role is to simplify some operations of the jupyter notebook, such as the switch between random behaviour and manual mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very raw node currently. In future, it could be developed more in order to obtain further simplifications on the Jupyter side. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the document\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the structure of this Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node Setup** : setup the node, ask for the topics and the services. This section implements the low level for every other functionality provided before.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Widgets** : definition of the widgets. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Widgets are not displayed until the next section, since there are some callbacks that need references to other widgets, so the order the widgets are defined doesn't agree with the way they should be represented. \n",
    "    For this reason, better to define first the wirdgets, and then visualize them. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Here *only the graphical aspect is defined.*\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Callbacks** : definition of the callbacks associated to the widgets. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Interface** : here widgets are displayed; also a map of the robot moving in the space is shown, with its position, trajectory, and orientation (represented as al arrow starting from the robot position). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Use this section to control the robot.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Data visualisations** : this section contains other two plots. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The first one represents the real velocity (in blue) Vs. the command given to the robot (in red). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The second  one is made up of two histograms: the first one represents how many goals has been cancelled or reached, whereas the second one represents how much time the successful goals required. "
